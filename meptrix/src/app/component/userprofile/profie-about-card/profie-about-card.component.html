      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 text-balance sm:text-lg">As an intern at The Sparks Foundation, I develop Android applications that solve real-world
        problems and create social impact. I use my skills in Java, MySQL, and Android Studio to design,
        build, and test user-friendly and functional apps that meet the needs and expectations of diverse
         users and stakeholders. I also collaborate with other interns and mentors to share feedback, ideas,
         and best practices, and to improve my coding and problem-solving abilities.
       In addition to my internship, I am the Google Developer Student Club (DSC) lead at Mepco Schlenk
       Engineering College, where I organize and facilitate workshops, hackathons, and projects that foster
        learning, innovation, and community among students. I am passionate about harnessing technology's
        potential for change, and I aim to inspire and empower others to do the same. Through the DSC,
        I have gained exposure to various technologies and domains, such as process automation, cloud
        computing, and artificial intelligence, and I have earned multiple certifications
       I am a pre-final year CSE student with a strong academic record and a drive to make a positive impact.
       I am dedicated to turning ideas into real-world solutions, and I seek opportunities to contribute and
        learn in a forward-thinking environment. I have participated in several hackathons, workshops, and
        collaborative projects that have shaped my versatile skill set and global perspective. Let's connect
        and create a future driven by innovation and excellence!As an intern at The Sp</p> <!--TODO Need to update at runtime get value from user -->
